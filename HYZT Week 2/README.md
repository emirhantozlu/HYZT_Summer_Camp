# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## Description

The Titanic disaster is significant both historically and from a human perspective. This tragic event, which occurred in 1912, has resulted in a dataset that is frequently used for machine learning and data analysis. In this project, participants are expected to develop a model that can predict the survival status of the passengers on the Titanic. 🛳️

The dataset includes various features of the passengers (e.g., age, gender, ticket class, number of siblings/spouses aboard) and their survival status. Participants will use these features to apply different classification models to predict survival status and evaluate the performance of these models. 📈

This project allows participants to develop their skills in data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to better understand the dynamics of the Titanic disaster and which passenger groups had a higher chance of survival. 🔍
